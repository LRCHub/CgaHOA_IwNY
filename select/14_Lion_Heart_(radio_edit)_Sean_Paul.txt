Bdi bang bang bang
Yeah yeah
Boop boop boop
My own opinion
Hey yow

Say from me born, them shoulda know me dangerous
Lion heart, that's just another name for us
Thru me don't like clash, me never do versus
Them a fly down pon me like some vampires
Them no read interview a just the headliners
When me tell them what clash ting remind me of
Them only use that to sell them papers

Guess you can't ever win against the real haters
Them a try step to me, me feel it in the air
But them a miss the point, so let me state this clear
Unity wah me say,
We need round here
Instead of this violence thing year to year

When me look an see
One, two, three see them all coming at me
Badmind and envy them a look company
One, two, three me a chat unity
But them still turn around and point finger pon me

So who's going to try to hate me now?
That's one thing they all would love to see
When they come I'mma be waiting
Me want know, who's gonna diss me now?
Misery would love the company
Them a try but them can't take away me sound

When me never say nothing
Them never call me name
Now as me have opinion them change the game
Them insane, them a try frame me, me can't lame
Thru me born as a champion me face the pain
When it rain me a tell you say me no complain
Me just give thanks for life and keep on saying
Jah will provide
No worry me brain, me just keep me head high
Me them can't contain

It's like
One, two, three see them all coming at me
Badmind and envy them a look company
One, two, three me a chat unity
But them still turn around and point finger pon me

So who's going to try to hate me now?
That's one thing they all would love to see
When they come I'mma be waiting
Me want know, who's gonna diss me now?
Misery would love the company
Them a try hard but no one fit know

Who's going to try to hate me now?
That's one thing they all would love to see
When they come I'mma be waiting
Me want to know, who's gonna try to diss me now?
Misery would love the company
Them a try but them can't take away me sound
