Heart of Lore or A Crown of Fate

Underworld
Now stirring
Another page is turning
The cauldrons
Of history
Bespeaking myth and mystery

Oracles and Witches
Wizards, fairies and sages
The masters
Returning
Unlocking gates and cages

Dark dragons, and demons
Breathe fire of grand illusions
Truth's armor
Is stronger
It rises through the ashes

(Ethereal section)

Heart of lore is calling
I will follow where it leads

Courage be with me
Leaving harbor for the sea

Turning the page
A crown of fate

Eye of destiny
May I travel by your wings
All powers that be

Holy grail of faith
Ever remain
