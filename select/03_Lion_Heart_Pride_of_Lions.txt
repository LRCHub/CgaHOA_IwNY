Some say the meek
Shall inherit the earth
And the poor shall be rich
And the last shall be first
Though I'd like to believe
That's not the world that I see

Against the odds
Stands a generous breed giving back
Is their code and their creed
For they know in their heart
By the grace of God that
Could be you and me

So they reach out to the broke and homeless
And they offer them more than their prayers

Lion heart
Helping the hopeless in times of need
Clothing the homeless with children to feed
Singing their song to the human spirit
Lion heart
Asking for nothing but peace of mind
Knowing that they've made a difference in lives
Their duty is doing their part
Woah-oh, loud as thunder
The roar of the lion heart

They say the pure
Have the power of ten
I've seen that to be true
Again and again
When you reach out your hand
The courage and grace travels back to you

And you find yourself a new kind of purpose
When you feel their smiles shining through

Lion heart
Helping the hopeless in times of need
Clothing the homeless with children to feed
Singing their song to the human spirit
Lion heart
Asking for nothing but peace of mind
Knowing that they've made a difference in lives
Their duty is doing their part
Woah-oh, loud as thunder
The roar of the lion heart

Shine a light on the kindness of strangers
Spread a little joy
Show them how much you care
Don't turn your eyes while they suffer in silence
Be what they need
In a life that's now always fair

Lion heart
Helping the hopeless in times of need
Clothing the homeless with children to feed
Singing their song to the human spirit
Lion heart
Asking for nothing but peace of mind
Knowing that they've made a difference in lives
Their duty is doing their part
Woah-oh, loud as thunder
The roar of the lion heart
Loud as thunder
The roar of the lion heart

Helping the hopeless in times of need
Clothing the homeless with children to feed
Singing their song to the human spirit
Lion heart (lion heart)
Asking for nothing but peace of mind
Knowing that they've made a difference in lives
Lion heart
Do your part
Woah-oh, lion heart
Woah-oh, lion heart
